= NeedyControllers

Needy Controllers is a way to DRY up commonly used tasks from both controllers and views to save time and effort. It consists of a single call with a number of options.

== Description

With needy controllers, you can include stylesheets, javascripts, and records in your controllers and views with a much greater deal of specificity and automation than hand-coding.

== Usage

To use Needy Controllers for styles and scripts, you simply call needs inside your controller like so:

class MyController < ApplicationController
  needs :styles => :standard
  needs :styles => :show, :only => :show
  needs :scripts => :behave, :except => :show

  def index
    # this action will have access to the 'standard.css' stylesheet
  end
  
  def show
    # this action will have access to the 'show.css' stylesheet
    # in addition to 'standard.css'
    # but will not have access to 'behave.js'
  end
end

To use Needy Controllers for fetching records, you use it similarly:

class MyController < ApplicationController
  # here's a standard problem
  needs :record => :user, :except => :index
  
  def index
    # no @user here
  end
  
  def show
    # you can access @user in your view for this action
  end
end
