= NeedyControllers

Needy Controllers is a way to DRY up commonly used tasks from both controllers and views to save time and effort. It consists of a single call with a number of options.

== Description

With needy controllers, you can include stylesheets, javascripts, and records in your controllers and views with a much greater deal of specificity and automation than hand-coding.

== Installation

script/plugin install http://svn.intridea.com/svn/public/needy_controllers

== Usage

=== Styles and Scripts

To use Needy Controllers for styles and scripts, you simply call needs inside your controller like so:

class MyController < ApplicationController
  needs :styles => :standard
  needs :styles => :show, :only => :show
  needs :scripts => :behave, :except => :show

  def index
    # this action will have access to the 'standard.css' stylesheet
  end
  
  def show
    # this action will have access to the 'show.css' stylesheet
    # in addition to 'standard.css'
    # but will not have access to 'behave.js'
  end
end

Now that you have created your behavior and style chains, you need to include them in the view. Luckily, this is exceedingly easy! Just include :needs in your include and link tags like so:

<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'something', :needs %>
<%= javascript_include_tag 'prototype', :needs, 'effects' %>

=== Model Fetching

To use Needy Controllers for fetching records, you use it similarly, and it sets the instance variable:

class MyController < ApplicationController
  # here's a standard problem
  needs :record => :user, :except => :index
  
  def index
    # no @user here
  end
  
  def show
    # you can access @user in your view for this action
  end
end

You can use :as to rename the instance variable and :from for the source id (default is params[:id]):

needs :record => :user, :as => :person, :from => params[:user_id]
